title: "📚 Getting Comfortable with Neovim: Book DB Project (v1)"
date: 2025-05-16

Hey folks! 👋  
It’s Paul again — still vibing, still exploring, and this time I’m kicking off a small but meaningful project to get more comfortable with **Neovim**.

To put my learning into practice, I’m building a **basic Book Database platform** using **Express** and **Node.js with SQLite**. It’s going to be simple, raw, and probably a bit rusty — but that’s the point: I’m not chasing perfection, just progress and hands-on learning.

## 📦 Version 1: Minimal Book DB API

Here’s what this first version will include:

- ✅ Create a new book record in the database  
- 📚 List all saved books  
- ❌ Delete a specific or selected book  
- 🔍 Retrieve a single book by its ID  

The goal isn’t to make it production-ready. I’m just getting into the groove of building from the terminal using Neovim, and this feels like the perfect starter challenge.

## 🧪 What’s Coming Next

This project will evolve over multiple versions:

### 🔁 Version 2:  
I'll build a small **wrapper around `node-sqlite`** to give it a feel similar to **Mongoose** — making queries cleaner and chaining easier.

### 🧼 Version 3:  
Refactor the existing Book DB logic using the wrapper from v2 — cleaner, more reusable, and more expressive.

### 🛠️ Version 4:  
A full overhaul:
- Admin interface for managing books  
- Public-facing interface for submitting book requests

## 📘 Side Quest: Learning Lua  
Alongside this, I’ll be reading _Programming in Lua (4th Edition)_ as part of my Neovim learning journey. It’s a slow burn, but I’m enjoying the process and trying not to rush.

Stay tuned for updates on how the Book DB project goes!  
**Neovim, here I come.**

Feel free to reach out if you're on a similar journey — I’m always open to learning with others.

— Paul ✌️
