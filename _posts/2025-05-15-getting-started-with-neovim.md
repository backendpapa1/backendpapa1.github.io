# Getting Started with Neovim and Lua

Today, I decided to dive into **Neovim**â€”but I quickly realized itâ€™s not just a text editor; itâ€™s a whole world.

While looking for beginner resources, I stumbled upon a fantastic YouTuber: **TJ Devries**. His content is incredibly helpful for anyone trying to get comfortable with Neovim, especially if you're looking to use Lua for configuration and plugins.

## First Stop: Learning Lua

Before getting into Neovimâ€™s guts, I figured I needed to understand **Lua**, the language Neovim now heavily relies on.

TJ has a great 30-minute intro to Lua:

Thatâ€™s my next stop. Once Iâ€™m through with thatâ€¦

## Next Up: Neovim Basics

Iâ€™ll follow it up with another TJ Devries videoâ€”this time focused on Neovim:

Both videos are short enough to finish in an hour. Iâ€™ll be watching, experimenting, and probably tweaking my config right away.

## Here Goes Nothing

Wish me luck. This is the beginning of my journey with Neovim + Lua.
