# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Paul

I'm currently diving deep into systems programming â€” exploring everything from C and Rust to building kernels and writing compilers. After 8+ years in web development, I realized I wanted to get closer to the metal and rediscover the joy of computing.

This blog is my open notebook â€” documenting my learning, wins, mistakes, and everything in between. My goal is to make code fun again, on my own terms, and hopefully inspire someone else to do the same.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Iâ€™m vibing with

- Neovim (my new home)
- Lua (slowly making sense)
- C, Rust, Go (low-level goodness)
- Building everything from the terminal up
